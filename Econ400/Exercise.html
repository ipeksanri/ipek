<p>
    In this exercise, you will decide whether to choose option A or B. You will be paid based on your decisions and assigned probabilities. In each row, both option A and B have different probabilities.</p>
 <p>
     For example, in row 1, if you choose option A, a dice will be thrown and if the dice comes as 1 you will earn 40 ECU, otherwise, you will be paid 32 ECU. If you choose option B, if dice comes 1, you will earn 77 ECU, otherwise 2 ECU. For the last row, if you choose option A, you will earn 40 ECU, and if you choose option B your earning will be 77 ECU for sure.
</p>
<b>8 ECU = 1 TL</b>
<p>
    Your payment will be made by randomly choosing one of your decisions in 10 rows, after the experiment ends.
</p>
<p>
    After the exercise, please answer the survey.
</p>
<p>
    Please choose one of the options for each row. The ratios are the probability of earning the stated ECU.
